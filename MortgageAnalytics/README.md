## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Data Integration

The dashboard is designed to integrate with Convex backend with the following assumed table structure:

- **customers**: Customer profiles with loyalty ratings, assets, etc.
- **offers**: Mortgage rate offers with promotional details
- **negotiations**: Negotiation rounds and outcomes
- **mortgages**: Final mortgage details and status tracking

## Features in Detail

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
- Clean card-based design with rounded corners
- Consistent color scheme and typography

### Interactive Charts
- Hover tooltips for detailed data points
- Responsive charts that adapt to screen size
- Multiple chart types: bar charts, line charts, funnel visualizations

### Export Functionality
- CSV export for all dashboard data
- Email reporting integration ready for OpenAI API
- Print-friendly layouts

### Mock Data
Currently uses mock data for development and demonstration purposes. In production, this would be replaced with real Convex queries.

## Customization

The dashboard is modular and easily customizable:

- Add new analytics sections by creating components in `src/components/analytics/`
- Modify styling through Tailwind classes
- Update data processing logic in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- Add new chart types using Recharts components

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for chart components
- Memoized calculations for data processing
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo where appropriate

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time data updates
- Advanced filtering and date range selection
- Custom dashboard layouts
- More detailed drill-down capabilities
- Integration with additional data sources
